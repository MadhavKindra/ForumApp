A 41-year wait finally ended when the Indian menâ€™s hockey team secured an Olympic medal by beating Germany 5-4 in a pulsating encounter in Tokyo on Thursday. Goals from Rupinder Pal Singh, Hardik Singh and Harmanpreet Singh, in addition to a brace from Simranjeet Singh saw India through. It was a topsy-turvy game in which India went 0-1 and then 1-3 down, conceding two goals in as many minutes, before launching a comeback. They went up 5-3 and had to endure some anxious moments, showing determination and defensive resolve to end one of the longest droughts in Indian sport. The Indian penalty corner battery was a constant threat, but they were also quite dangerous in open play, often catching the Germans with swift counter-attacks."
